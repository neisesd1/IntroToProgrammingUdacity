    "##### Overview\n",
    "The data being worked on here was taken from a database housing data about soccer teams, players, and matches in Europe. The downloaded database contains data organized into 7 tables : Country, League, Match, Player, Player_Attributes, Team, and Team_Attributes. This information is from 7 total seasons of soccer, spanning from 2008 to 2015. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Notes on Data\n",
    "There are a few things about the data that need to be acknowledged. The countries included in the data are limited to 11 countries. Along with the 11 countries, there is only one league per country, the highest level league of that country. Additionally, although team goals are recorded, the match table doesn't include any information on the player that scored the goal. "
