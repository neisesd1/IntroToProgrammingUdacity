    "The data being worked on here was taken from a database housing data about soccer teams, players, and matches in Europe. The downloaded database contains data organized into 7 tables : Country, League, Match, Player, Player_Attributes, Team, and Team_Attributes. This information is from 7 total seasons of soccer, spanning from 2008 to 2015. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Notes on Data\n",
    "There are a few things about the data that need to be acknowledged. The countries included in the data are limited to 11 countries. Along with the 11 countries, there is only one league per country, the highest level league of that country. Additionally, although team goals are recorded, the match table doesn't include any information on the player that scored the goal. "

From this graph, we can conclude that there is a benefit to being home team, as it produces an average winning percentage of about double than away teams. On average, away teams win 30% or less of their away games. (Season 6 being the outlier with about 40%) However, home teams win more than 50% of their games at home on average, with most seasons being at least 60%. "

    "After seeing Real Madrid and Barcelona in the top ten every year, I wanted to investigate them a little more. This graph shows the total number of goals scored by these two teams every season. And to put it in perspective, I added another team that showed up in the top ten a couple of times, Juventus. Real Madrid and Barcelona have a very close relationship, with each team scoring in between about 90 and 110 goals a season. These are the superpower teams and their results. Juventus is more of an average to good team, and schores roughly 70 goals a game. "

    "### Section 4: Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "After exploring this data and addressing the questions I've stated above, I can make several conclusions regarding what I've learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In regards to individual players and their attributes, I've determined that certain characteristics influence other characteristics. For example, in my analysis, I've come to the conclusion that the age of a player will affect the speed of a player. The older the player, the more likely that the overall sprint speed will be lower. This is proven by looking at all players' age and sprint speed, taking the values, and finding a negative correlation of .37. Its not a super strong correlation, but it does indicate a relatively strong correlation. Another example of player attibutes is how height correlates to sprint speed and strength of a player. I've concluded that the taller a player, the slower the sprint speed, as well as the taller the player, the stronger. This is demonstrated in the correlation equation, which shows that height is negatively correlated to sprint speed by .44, and is positively correlated with strength by .58.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "2. Another conclusion I have made from analyzing this data is that home teams are more likely to score more goals throughout the season than away teams. To prove this, I derived the average amount of goals scored in a season for home teams and the average amount of goals scored in a season for away teams. After doing this for each season, I graphed the results, which clearly show a 6-7 goal difference in home team vs away team average goals scored in each of the 8 seasons. I can also conclude that home teams are also more likely to win as opposed to away teams. This was demonstrated by cycling through each season of matches and determining the winner of each match by looking at home goals scored and away goals scored. After this, I took the winning percentage of home teams and the winning percentage of away teams. This was done for each season, with the results illustrated in a graph. The graph shows each season and the winning percentage of away teams vs the winning percentage of home teams. In each season, the home team won significantly more games than the away team.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "3. I've also made some conclusions regarding some interesting facts from the data:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "*Players*<br>\n",
    "The average height of a player is 181 cm. The tallest player in soccer is Kristof van Hout, standing at 208 cm tall. The shortest player is Juan Quero, standing at 157 cm tall. Additionally, I displayed the heights of all players in a histogram bar chart. From this chart, I can conclude that the vast majority of players are in between 180 and 190 cm tall. This group of players outnumbers the next closest group of players (170-180cm) by almost 2 times, and the next closest group (190-200cm) by almost 6 times.<br>\n",
    "I've also derived some pretty cool insights regarding player age. I've discovered that the average age of all players is 31 years old, which also happens to be the median. The mode age of all players is 30. I learned that the oldest player is Alberto Fontana, at the age of 51. The youngest players are 19 years old, and they are Alban Lafont, Gianluigi Donnarumma', and Jonathan Leko. What really surprised me was the graph that I made illustrating the players' ages. In the graph, I was suprised to see so many older players. For example, there was a large number of players over the age of 45! Also, the most common age group of players is in between 30-35 years old. This seems so old for professional soccer players!<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "*Teams*<br>\n",
    "When it comes to teams and their performances, I've come to some fascinating conclusions after looking at the data. I wanted to know who scored the most goals in a game as an away team and as a home team. The results I got show that the most goals scored by an away team is 9 goals. This was done by Paris Saint-Germain on March 13th, 2016, and was done against the home team ES Troyes AC. The most goals scored by a home team is 10 goals (happened on two seperate occasions). The teams to have done this are PSV and Real Madrid CF. PSV did it against Feyenoord on October 24th, 2010, while Real Madrid did it against Rayo Vallecano on December 20th, 2015. <br>\n",
    "I continued to look at teams and goals scored, and discovered that the lowest total amount of goals scored in a season is 17. On the contrary, the largest amount of goals scored in one season was 121. This was a surpising difference, and led me to look further into which teams have scored the most goals over the seasons. What I discovered was that Real Madrid and Barcelona were always at the top of the list in terms of goals scored. Barcelona led the league in scoring 3 out of 8 seasons, while Real Madrid led 4 seasons. This really stood out to me, as it has a high degree of difficulty to be the leading scoring team in a season. It shows how dominant these two teams are. This led me to do a little more digging on these two teams. I graphed the amount of goals scored by these two teams, while also graphing the goals scored by another team that only appeared in the top ten once (representing a more 'average' team to compare against). Barcelona and Real Madrid lines follow each other pretty close, while the Juventus line is much much lower. Additionally, I created a table that showed the amount of times a team was in the top ten in scoring for a season. Real Madrid and Barcelona were in the top ten in every single season! Again, this draws me to the conlusion of how dominant Barcelona and Real Madrid is.\n",

    "*Overall Conclusions*<br>\n",
    "Overall, I can conclude a few things. Player height and age do correlate with things like speed and strength. The age of players playing soccer is much higher than I thought, leading me to believe that players can have potentially very long careers in soccer. Also, I can conclude that being a home team is far more beneficial than being an away team. You are more likely to score more goals in a season as well as much more likely to win as a home team. I've also come to the conlcusion that Barcelona and Real Madrid are the two most dominant teams. They have scored the most goals over 8 seasons and conssitently show up in the top ten scoring list. Lastly, I graphed the total goals scored by top ten scoring teams in each season, and can conclude that the overall trend in goals scored is going up. <br>\n",

    "*Limitations*<br>\n",
    "There were a few things the data didn't provide that I wish I could look at. One things is the team that the player is on. I can't look at things like \"when this player scores, does the team have a better chance of winning?\". Also, it doesn't show who scored the goals. I can't look at who scored the most goals in a season, or the relationship between a team winning and a player scoring. "
